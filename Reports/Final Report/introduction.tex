\section{Motivation}

The investigation of droplet impact and evaporation is an area of interest and application to various industries. Examples of these include milk powder spray drying, ink jet printing, and applications of evaporative cooling. This project will continue on from a previous instrumentation setup, evaluating its shortcomings, and designing the next generation. This will improve the reliability and usability of the collected data from the previous setup, and introduce methods of automating the process.

Applications of interest
\begin{itemize}
    \item Spray cooling
    \item  powder (Milk) manufacture
    \item ink-jet printing
    \item \dots
\end{itemize}

\section{Goals}
Goal: To characterise behaviour of a droplet impacting and evaporating from a given substrate.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Increase Repeatability and Reliability of results
    \item Increase usability of process via automation
    \item Produce Extendible platform that can be built upon beyond this projects scope
\end{itemize}
