\chapter{Future Plan}\label{C:fut} 
Now that parts have arrived for a base deliverable prototype. Electronics can be assembled into rig, power and driving requirements can be properly determined and the new automated process can be tested and refined.

\section{Work to be Completed}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Assemble first motorised version (Immediately-2Wks)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Recut tower to new height
        \item Mount R stage stepper to stage and tower 
        \item Design sliding shaft coupler for z stage micrometre
    \end{itemize}
    \item Integrate Firmware using test code a base to get things moving (1wk - 2wks)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Collect power requirement data
        \item Evaluate performance in terms of vibration, backlash and stability
        \item Begin running 'wet' runs with motorised droplet dispensing
    \end{itemize}
    \item Interface with electronic pipette to remotely trigger droplet dispense from controller (1wk - 2wks)
    \item Running continuous testing run to optimise driving variables to minimising vibration and collect experimental data to compare to previous rigs performance (week 2 onwards)
    \item Add environmental monitoring/data collection (end of prototyping, 5wks)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Bulk of redesigning and prototyping done during this storage
        \item Informs the design of new parts, requirement for more components etc
    \end{itemize}
    \item Move electronic components "motherboard PCB" and finalise integrated rig design and automating procedure for final deliverable(Final 4 weeks)
\end{enumerate}
